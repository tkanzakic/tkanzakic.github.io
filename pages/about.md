My name is Takeichi Kanzaki Cabrera, cuban born living in Spain since
January 2008. Father of a beautiful girl (and another one coming soon).

My first contact with a *computer* was in 1994, it was a *smart keyboard* where
I was able to *write code* in `qbasic`, that day I decided I will go for a
Software Engineering career. I started my bachelor degree in Computer Science
in 1999 in the University of Holgu√≠n, Cuba.

I moved to Spain in 2008 to do a PhD in Computational Physics. My research was
about molecular dynamics simulations of *irregular* (non-spherical) particles.

My started playing with the iOS SDK in 2011, I was about to finish my PhD and
was looking for the next thing to do, and I felt in love with the iOS platform
and Objective-C, that might sounds weird but yes, **I like Objective-C**.

For the last three years I have been working for
[Curelator Inc](https://curelator.com), a USA startup in the healthcare area.
I started as Senior iOS Engineer and after a year I get promoted to Technical
lead role. In my day to day I mainly write code for iOS, but also do *small
things* in python and javascript.

I am a sport lover, I enjoy both watching and
[practicing](https://www.strava.com/athletes/24688666).
